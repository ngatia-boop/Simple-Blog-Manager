# 📝 Blog Manager App

Welcome to the **Blog Manager**, a simple web application for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting blog posts using a mock API. This project is designed to demonstrate the following skills:

- Making GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests using `fetch()`
- Rendering and updating the DOM dynamically
- Managing user events through event listeners

---

## 🚀 Project Features

- 📄 **View Blog Posts**: Displays a list of blog post titles and shows full post details when clicked.
- ➕ **Add New Post**: Submit a form to create a new post.
- 🛠️ **Edit Post**: Click “Edit” on a post to modify its title and content.
- ❌ **Delete Post**: Click “Delete” to remove a post from the list.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project helped me practice:

- Accessing information from an API using a **GET request**.
- Listening for user events and updating the DOM dynamically.
- Sending data to an API using **POST**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE** requests.
- Writing clean, modular JavaScript code.
